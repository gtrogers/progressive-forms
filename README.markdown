# What is this?

This is an example of using javascript + jQuery to make a web form slightly 'nicer'.

If javascript is not available it works as a regular form.

## Getting it to work

Everything is static, you'll just need a local HTTP server.

If you have python then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the project directory and hit `http://localhost:8000`

## Note

How to make this 'production' quality

- Add tests
- Refactor to control scope / use module pattern
- Document used data attributes and CSS classes
- Validate useability as we hijack some keyboard events
